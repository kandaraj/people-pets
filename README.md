A learning exercise on node JS to write basic console app 

####Running the app

```
npm install
npm start
```

####Testing the app

```
npm test
```

####System requirement


Developed and tested in Windows 10, with current version of [node 6.4.0] (https://nodejs.org/en/), running with [conemu] (https://conemu.github.io/)

Intially, developed in [ES6] (http://es6-features.org/), then changed into ES5, just in case if anyone using older version node which does not support ES6. I did not want to go into trouble of using babel to convert.


Send me a pull request if I can be improved anywhere, your feedback is appreciated.
